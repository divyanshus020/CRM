MERN Billing Challan ApplicationThis is a full-stack web application built with the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack that allows users to create, manage, and print professional billing challans. Users can manage their own business profile, maintain a customer list, and generate challans with dynamic item tables and automatic calculations.FeaturesUser Authentication: Secure user registration and login system using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).Business Profile Management: Users can save and update their business details (Name, Address, GST No.) which are automatically populated on each challan.Customer Management: Ability to add and save customer information for quick selection during challan creation.Dynamic Challan Creation: An intuitive form to create challans with a table for adding multiple line items (products/services, quantity, rate).Automatic Calculations: Real-time calculation of line item totals, sub-total, GST, and the final grand total.Challan Dashboard: A central dashboard to view, search, and manage all previously created challans.Print-Friendly Output: Generate a clean, professional, and printer-friendly version of the challan with a single click.Technology StackFrontend:React.jsReact RouterTailwind CSSAxiosBackend:Node.jsExpress.jsDatabase:MongoDB (with Mongoose)Authentication:JSON Web Tokens (JWT)bcryptjs (for password hashing)Getting StartedFollow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.PrerequisitesNode.js and npm (or yarn) installedMongoDB installed locally or a connection string from a cloud provider like MongoDB Atlas.InstallationClone the repository:git clone https://github.com/your-username/billing-app.git
cd billing-app
Set up the Backend (Server):# Navigate to the server directory
cd server

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create a .env file in the /server directory and add the following variables:
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key

# Start the backend server
npm start
The server will be running on http://localhost:5000 (or your configured port).Set up the Frontend (Client):# Navigate to the client directory from the root folder
cd ../client

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the React development server
npm start
The client will be running on http://localhost:3000.Project Folder Structure/billing-app

API EndpointsAll API routes are prefixed with /api.Auth Routes: /authPOST /register: Create a new user.POST /login: Log a user in and return a JWT.GET /me: Get the logged-in user's profile.Challan Routes: /challansPOST /: Create a new challan.GET /: Get all challans for the logged-in user.GET /:id: Get a single challan by its ID.PUT /:id: Update a challan.DELETE /:id: Delete a challan.Customer Routes: /customersPOST /: Create a new customer.GET /: Get all customers for the logged-in user.Development RoadmapThis project is planned to be developed in the following phases:Phase 1: Setup & Backend FoundationInitialize project structure and install all dependencies.Set up the Express server and establish a connection to MongoDB.Create all Mongoose data models (User, Customer, Challan).Phase 2: Backend APIs & AuthenticationImplement user registration and login logic with JWT.Build all CRUD API endpoints for challans and customers.Secure routes using authentication middleware.Test all endpoints using Postman or a similar tool.Phase 3: Frontend Layout & AuthenticationSet up React Router for page navigation.Build core layout components (Navbar, etc.).Create registration and login pages and connect them to the backend.Implement global state management (e.g., React Context) for user authentication.Phase 4: Core Feature - Challan CreationDevelop the NewChallanPage and its ChallanForm component.Implement the dynamic items table for adding/removing products.Add real-time calculation logic for totals.Connect the form to the backend to save new challans.Phase 5: Display, Manage, and PrintBuild the DashboardPage to display a list of existing challans.Create the ViewChallanPage to show a single challan's details.Implement the print functionality with a dedicated print-friendly stylesheet.Phase 6: Final Touches & DeploymentBuild the SettingsPage for users to update their profile.Refine the overall UI/UX, add loading indicators, and implement comprehensive error handling.Prepare the application for deployment.
